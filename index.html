            <h2>What is Fitness & How to Maintain It</h2>
            <p>Fitness is the perfect harmony of strength, endurance, flexibility, and mental well-being. It's not just about lifting weights or running miles — it's a lifestyle that fuels your body and mind.</p>
            <p>To maintain it: Move daily with purpose, eat nourishing whole foods, prioritize recovery through sleep and rest, stay hydrated, and most importantly — be consistent.</p>
            <p>Small steps compound into massive results. Celebrate progress, not perfection. Your body is capable of amazing things when you treat it with care and challenge.</p>
            <p>Start where you are, use what you have, and do what you can. Fitness is a journey — enjoy every step!</p>
