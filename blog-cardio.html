            <h2>Benefits of Cardio Workouts</h2>
            <p>Cardio, or aerobic exercise, is any activity that raises your heart rate and keeps it elevated. It’s one of the best things you can do for your health — improving heart function, burning fat, boosting mood, and increasing longevity.</p>

            <p>Regular cardio strengthens your heart, lowers blood pressure, improves cholesterol, and reduces risk of diabetes and heart disease. It also releases endorphins, helping fight stress and anxiety.</p>

            <h3>Types of Cardio</h3>
            <p>Steady-state cardio (jogging, cycling) builds endurance. HIIT (high-intensity interval training) burns more fat in less time. Both have benefits — mix them for best results.</p>

            <p>Beginners can start with walking, swimming, or jumping rope. Aim for 150 minutes moderate or 75 minutes vigorous cardio per week.</p>

            <p>Combine cardio with strength training. See our <a href="blog-leg.html">leg day</a> or <a href="blog-full.html">full body workout</a> guides for balance.</p>

            <p>Cardio isn’t just for weight loss — it’s for living longer and feeling better every day. Start moving today!</p>
