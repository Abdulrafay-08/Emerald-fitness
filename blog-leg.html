            <h2>Benefits of Leg Day Workouts</h2>
            <p>Leg day workout is one of the most important parts of any fitness routine. While many people love training upper body, skipping leg day can create imbalances and limit overall progress. In this detailed guide, we explore why leg day is essential, its benefits, best exercises, and how to make the most of your lower body training.</p>

            <p>The lower body contains some of the largest muscle groups — quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. Training these muscles not only builds strength and size but also boosts metabolism because big muscles burn more calories even at rest. One major benefit of leg day workouts is the release of growth hormones like testosterone and HGH, which help muscle growth all over the body.</p>

            <h3>Top Leg Day Exercises</h3>
            <p>Squats are the king of leg exercises, hitting quads, glutes, and core. Lunges improve balance and fix left-right imbalances. Deadlifts (especially Romanian) target hamstrings and lower back. Calf raises complete the lower leg. Add these to your leg day workout for balanced development.</p>

            <p>Proper form is crucial to avoid injury. Always warm up, use progressive overload, and allow recovery time. Nutrition matters too — eat enough protein and carbs after your leg day session.</p>
