            <h2>Benefits of Full Body Workouts</h2>
            <p>Full body workouts are one of the most efficient ways to train. Instead of splitting muscle groups across different days, you work everything in one session. This approach is perfect for beginners, busy people, and anyone wanting great results with less time in the gym.</p>

            <p>Research shows full body training 3 times per week can build as much muscle and strength as split routines, but with fewer sessions. You get better recovery between workouts and higher frequency per muscle group — key for growth.</p>

            <h3>Why Full Body Works So Well</h3>
            <p>Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench press, and rows hit multiple muscles at once. This burns more calories, improves coordination, and builds real-world strength. Full body workouts also keep hormone levels elevated longer, supporting fat loss and muscle gain.</p>

            <p>They’re great for fat loss too — more muscle worked means higher calorie burn. Plus, you only need 45-60 minutes per session.</p>
